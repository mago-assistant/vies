# Mago Assistant example skill: VIES VAT check

A complete, working Mago Assistant skill in one class. It validates an EU VAT number against
[VIES](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/), the European Commission's register, which needs
no API key.

## What it does

Ask the assistant, in the admin chat panel:

- *Is btw-nummer NL810433941B01 geldig?*
- *Check the VAT number on order 000000563*

It answers whether the number is registered, and — if the member state shares them — the registered
company name and address.

## Install

```bash
composer require mago-assistant/magento2-vies:*
bin/magento module:enable MagoAssistant_Vies
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento cache:flush
```

## The whole skill is two files

### `etc/di.xml` — the registration

```xml
<type name="MagoAssistant\Mago\Service\Tool\ToolRegistry">
    <arguments>
        <argument name="tools" xsi:type="array">
            <item name="vies_vat_check" xsi:type="object">MagoAssistant\Vies\Service\Tool\VatCheck</item>
        </argument>
    </arguments>
</type>
```

That is all of it. Nothing inside `MagoAssistant_Mago` is edited, and the item name is the name the
model sees and calls.

### `Service/Tool/VatCheck.php` — the tool

One class implementing `MagoAssistant\Mago\Api\Tool\ToolInterface`. Eight methods:

| Method | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `getName()` | The name the model calls. Matches the `di.xml` item name. |
| `getDescription()` | How the model decides to pick this tool over another one. |
| `getParameterSchema()` | JSON Schema for the arguments. |
| `getMagentoAcl()` | The admin resource the caller must hold. |
| `isReadOnly()` / `isReadOnlyAction()` | Whether a call can change anything. `false` means the admin is asked to confirm first. |
| `getFieldClassification()` | How each returned field may cross to the model. |
| `getInstructions()` | Presentation guidance, delivered *after* the first call. |
| `execute()` | The work. |

## The four things that are easy to get wrong

**1. Undeclared fields are dropped, silently.** `getFieldClassification()` is a whitelist, not a
hint. A field `execute()` returns that is not listed here never reaches the model, and you will see
the assistant answer as if the data were not there. When a skill "loses" data, check this list
first.

**2. Personal data is masked, not removed.** `name` and `address` are declared `TOKENISE`, so the
model receives `mago://name_1` and the administrator sees the real value in the panel. For a
registered company that name is public record, but for a sole trader it is a person's name and home
address — so it is masked either way. Use `PiiClass::PUBLIC` only for data that is genuinely not
personal.

**3. The model fills in every parameter you offer.** If you put a parameter in the schema, expect it
to arrive whether or not the question called for one. Removing a parameter is a far stronger lever
than writing a description asking the model not to use it.

**4. `getInstructions()` arrives after the first call, not before.** So it is the place to say how to
present an answer, never which arguments to pass. Anything about calling belongs in
`getDescription()` and the parameter schema, which the model reads first.
